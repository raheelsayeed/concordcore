      patient:
        True: |
          
          The following lifestyle measures can help manage blood cholesterol

          - __Eating healthy__ A diet high in saturated fat (red meat, poultry, butter, cheese) can raise LDL cholesterol. Balancing your diet with  lean meat, skinless poultry, whole grain, fruits and vegetables can help lower risk of heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event.
          - __Being physically active__
            Sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for developing heart disease. A good starting point is at least 150 minutes of physical activity a week.
          - __Track Levels__
            Keeping track of your cholesterol levels over time will help you and your doctor better assess your health and progress.
          - __Avoid exposure to tobacco or smoking products__
            Smoking raises blood pressure and lowers HDL (good cholesterol) which raises the risk of clot formation and heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event.
