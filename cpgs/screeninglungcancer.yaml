    Associating risk with pack years also ignores the fact that lung cancer occurs in never-smokers. In fact, lung cancer in never-smokers is among the top 10 causes of cancer deaths in the United States.

        A 2018 study found that for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pack years might not be the best way to measure. How long they've smoked was more closely linked with COPD than the "cigarettes per day in pack-years" estimates.

    title: USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit
    description: USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT has a __moderate net benefit__ in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on __age__, total cumulative exposure to __tobacco smoke__, and years since quitting smoking. The moderate net benefit of screening depends on limiting screening to persons at high risk, the accuracy of image interpretation being similar to or better than that found in clinical trials, and the resolution of most false-positive results with serial imaging rather than invasive procedures.

    narrative:
      provider:
        True: In an effort to minimize the uncertainty and variation about the evaluation and management of lung nodules and to standardize the reporting of LDCT screening results, the American College of Radiology developed the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) classification system and endorses its use in lung cancer screening.20 Lung-RADS provides guidance to clinicians on which findings are suspicious for cancer and the suggested management of lung nodules detected on LDCT. Data suggest that the use of Lung-RADS may decrease the rate of false-positive results in lung cancer screening.

# Implementation of Lung Cancer Screening
# Available data indicate that uptake of lung cancer screening is low. One recent study using data for 10 states found that 14.4% of persons eligible for lung cancer screening (based on 2013 USPSTF criteria) had been screened in the prior 12 months.18 Increasing lung cancer screening discussions and offering screening to eligible persons who express a preference for it is a key step to realizing the potential benefit of lung cancer screening.

# Shared Decision-making
# Shared decision-making is important when clinicians and patients discuss screening for lung cancer. The benefit of screening varies with risk because persons at higher risk are more likely to benefit. Screening does not prevent most lung cancer deaths; thus, smoking cessation remains essential. Lung cancer screening has the potential to cause harm, including false-positive results and incidental findings that can lead to subsequent testing and treatment, including the anxiety of living with a lung lesion that may be cancer. Overdiagnosis of lung cancer and the risks of radiation exposure are harms, although their exact magnitude is uncertain. The decision to undertake screening should involve a thorough discussion of the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening.
